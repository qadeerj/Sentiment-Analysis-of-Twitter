# üê¶ Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Flask & Logistic Regression

This project focuses on **Twitter Sentiment Analysis**, where the goal is to classify tweets into **positive** or **negative** sentiments. The project is built using a Flask web application, with a Logistic Regression model trained on a pre-processed dataset of 1.6 million tweets.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies tweets as positive or negative based on user input.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Trained from scratch using **Scikit-learn** for efficient sentiment classification.
- **User Authentication**: Users can **sign up**, **log in**, and manage their profiles.
- **Analysis History**: Users can view their **previous sentiment analyses**.
- **Blog Functionality**: Share insights via the integrated **blog**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap** for a responsive and modern user interface.

### Backend:
- **Flask** (Python web framework) for handling user requests and serving the sentiment analysis.

### Database:
- **SQLite** (or **MySQL** in production) for storing user data, sentiment history, and blog posts.

### Machine Learning Model:
- **Logistic Regression** (Scikit-learn) for binary sentiment classification.
- **TF-IDF** vectorizer for feature extraction from text data.

### Deployment:
- **Flask** for local deployment.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains **1.6 million pre-labeled tweets** (positive/negative sentiment). The data was cleaned and pre-processed, and then vectorized using **TF-IDF** to convert textual data into numerical features for model training.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Training

- **Logistic Regression** was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification.
- The tweets were transformed into numerical features using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.
- **Cross-validation** was applied to ensure the model's accuracy and robustness during training and evaluation.
